Not making any change to the validator looks weird to me. Does it work ?

And for unfixed vulnerabilities, we also need to be able to mark all versions as impacted (so no upper bound)

The validator does not care about the value of the `time` entry, it just validates that it's present.

For the upper bound, it's just a matter of using a very high version, I don't think we need anything special here. As done in #241 (even if I would use a version a bit higher than `9`, let's say `999`).

I think trying to keep the current semantic as much as possible is important here.

but setting to `null` will not be considered as there when checking with `isset`
